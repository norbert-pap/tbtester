Staff Full Stack Engineer, User Auth Experience
===============================================

Who we are
----------

### About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### About the team

Large, complex businesses on Stripe have historically had to create a new Stripe account for each global entity or business unit—making it difficult to unify reporting and manage payment operations across all accounts. Our customers want a way to manage these accounts under one umbrella so they can operate at scale more efficiently.

We are responsible for building Organizations, which allows merchants to effectively and centrally manage their businesses across multiple Stripe accounts. As Stripe continues to grow its suite of product offerings beyond payments, Organizations will unlock a new phase of growth for Stripe. We will do this by enabling our platforms and businesses to model their complex businesses and distribute all of Stripe’s products to their end users.

You can read more about what we are working on [here](https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-organizations-powering-the-worlds-most-complex-businesses) (our Stripe Blog).

What you’ll do
--------------

As a leader on the User Auth Experience team, you will help shape the team’s vision and roadmap, guide and mentor your peers, and lead by example. Authentication, Login, and general Account Security experiences are deeply cross-cutting areas at Stripe with critical security, safety, and quality considerations. You will work with many partner teams: peer engineering organizations to build robust/reusable/standardized access controls, as well as non-engineer groups to shape the security, beauty, and usability of the end-to-end journey of Stripe account authentication. You’ll play a major role in Stripe’s defense strategy, keeping users and data protected from fraudulent activity through intelligently assessing risk and refining user workflows accordingly.

As an engineer on the team, you’ll directly build well-tested APIs, UX/UI pieces, and analytics engines for defining and measuring the full-stack Dashboard authentication story, elevating the experience for every end user. By creating and expanding these account management “building blocks”, you’ll build out a generalized authentication platform that can be leveraged to bring best-in-class usability and security to multiple Stripe-owned surfaces—multiplying the efforts of product teams to more quickly and confidently build safe, controlled features.

### Responsibilities

*   Build beautiful web experiences and secure full-stack authentication machinery that impacts millions of users  
    
*   Make effective tradeoffs that consider business priorities, user experience, and a sustainable technical foundation  
    
*   Drive sound technical decision-making and lead technical conversations with other teams across Stripe  
    
*   Shape your team’s culture, roadmap, and vision through your guidance, mentorship, foresight, and technical and social expertise.  
    
*   As a leader within Engineering, assist with growth and development of your team and organization while maintaining a high bar for excellence and technical curiosity  
    

Who you are
-----------

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

### Minimum requirements

*   8+ years of experience in full-time software development roles  
    
*   Experience as a technical lead by guiding your team, influencing its roadmap, and overseeing complex projects spanning multiple teams  
    
*   Experience in both frontend and backend, with strong ability to work as a generalist across the stack  
    
*   Thrive in a collaborative environment with other teams to identify high-impact ways of solving problems quickly  
    
*   Excellent oral and written communication  
    

### Preferred qualifications

*   You strive for simple solutions and designs over complex ones, and have a good intuition for what will last and scale well  
    
*   Expertise working at the intersection of security and authentication systems, with the ability to drive partnerships with our Security and Fraud partner teams.   
    
*   Strong understanding of IAM concepts, including Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and identity governance.  
    
*   Experience building scalable, resilient, and observable systems while understanding UX best practices for the frontend  
    
*   You can put yourself in the shoes of your users to understand their needs and fit that into the bigger picture  
    
*   You stitch together many different services and processes, even if you have not worked with them before  
    
*   Experience with building software for fellow developers  
    

Hybrid work at Stripe
=====================

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits
================

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$208,000 - C$312,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.
