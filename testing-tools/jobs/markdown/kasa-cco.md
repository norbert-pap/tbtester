### **About Kasa**

Kasa is the leading tech-enabled hotel and apartment hotel brand and manager. Kasa has built a hospitality operating system that fundamentally improves the profitability of hospitality assets while delivering a high quality, digitally forward experience to guests. We partner with owners of multifamily and boutique hospitality properties to deliver stylish, professionally managed accommodations to business and leisure travelers alike. We took the best that hotels and short-term rentals had to offer and created a new class of hospitality that is well-priced, reliable, and offers a large selection of great locations.

Unlike traditional hotel operators, we prioritize **automation, AI-driven pricing, and data-driven decision-making** to optimize revenue and improve guest experiences.

#### **Note: this role is fully remote. Some job boards require a location but our team is geographically dispersed.** 

**The Role** 
-------------

As Chief Commercial Officer (CCO), you will lead and optimize Revenue Management, Distribution Marketing, and Sales across Kasa’s portfolio. Reporting directly to the CEO, this role will closely interface with the Chief Product Officer (CPO), from which engineering and Data Science resources will be routinely applied (though not directly controlled). The role will also frequently collaborate with the Real Estate Development team, instilling trust with existing partners and supporting the closure of prospective deals.

The CCO will oversee a team of **20+ people** in **Revenue** **Management**, **Distribution**, **Marketing,** and **Sales**. Over time, the CCO will **hire and** **structure departmental leadership** to drive high performance in each function. Kasa measures its leaders not by the size of their teams but by the impact they deliver. The successful leader at Kasa embraces this mentality.

Because Kasa’s properties range in size from 5 keys to over 200 keys, existing approaches to commercial function are often inefficient and ineffective. Kasa needs to innovate on these approaches to deliver successful performance to its owners. This is an opportunity to **redefine hospitality revenue strategy** by **integrating AI, automation, and dynamic pricing models**, ensuring Kasa remains at the forefront of industry innovation.
