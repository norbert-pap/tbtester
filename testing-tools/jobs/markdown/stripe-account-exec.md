Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### About the team

Stripe’s Startups, SMB & Commercial Team is at the forefront of driving revenue and growth. As trusted business partners, our goal is to help users understand Stripe products and integrate them with ease so they can concentrate on what’s most important to them: their business. We’re known for our product expertise, rigorous thinking, and user-first approach to problem solving. Within Stripe, Sales proudly serves as a critical source of user feedback and market intelligence, with direct influence on Stripe’s product roadmap and growth strategy.

The Startups, SMB and Commercial Team is very international and diverse. Apart from Stripes Operating Principles, the team's guiding principles are fun and collaboration. We are looking for a team member who is open to sharing knowledge across teams and open to learn from each other - Always stay curious.

What you’ll do
--------------

As an Account Executive for Commercial T2 (100-250 employees), you will drive Stripe’s future growth engine by building relationships with prospective clients and turning them into satisfied Stripe users. You'll manage both inbound and outbound leads, serving as the first point of contact for many new and growing businesses interested in Stripe. You will also be responsible for generating your own outbound leads. You’ll handle the full sales cycle, including onboarding new users. You're an energetic and organized self-starter; you understand the sales process, can build relationships with the right decision-makers, and can succinctly define and communicate the specific benefits of Stripe that are appropriate for each user.

*   Generate your own leads through cold calling, blitzing, research, networking, and driving your territory  
    
*   Manage leads qualified by our inbound and outbound sales development representatives  
    
*   Ensure that every potential Stripe user has a positive experience with every interaction, regardless of deal size
