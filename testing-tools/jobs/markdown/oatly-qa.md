Apply for this job

Hello potential future Oatly employee. It’s us, the original oatmilk company that started in Sweden back 25 or so years ago and has since expanded to the U.S. where we’ve continued growing at a rate such that we need more brilliant minds to come work with us to keep the momentum going and the oatmilk flowing.

Sustainability, health, and transparency are the core values that guide everything we do. Basically, we exist to make it easy for people to eat better and live healthier lives without recklessly taxing the planet’s resources in the process. If any of this resonates with you, then maybe you’d like work for Oatly, too. Now onto the formal stuff.

**Here's the things we want to hire you to do:**

*   Develop and optimize quality assurance according to BRC regulations
*   Develop new SOPs regarding quality and train the department operators in quality SOPs
*   Carry out internal and external audits/inspections along with the other quality team members, e.g BRC, FDA, HACCP, FSMA Halal, Kosher, gluten free etc.
*   Support Quality Manager with regulatory activities, including audits, inspections, license renewals, and interaction with state agencies
*   Actively follow up deviations within site, complaints from hybrid partner and other co manufacturers as well as complaints on hybrid partner products on market
*   Support the operators and other functions to investigate and close deviations and complaints
*   Act as a key liaison between Oatly and co-manufactures for documentation and audit-related activities
*   Act as a quality resource in innovation and CAPEX projects
*   Collaborate with Quality Manager and support cross-functional teams on continuous improving quality projects, including LIMS and Q-Route Building Block activities
*   Participate and develop plans for verification and validation of equipment, and changes in process or products (commissioning)
*   Assist in troubleshooting and root cause analysis in resolving facility non-conformances, e.g. Holds, complaints, food safety, audit finding and quality incidents
*   Monitor and verify compliance with SOPs, work instructions
*   Assist with SOP and work instruction training to ensure understanding and consistent application across all teams
*   Verify completion of daily pre-operational and operational plant inspections and make decisions on startup production in processing operations, in conjunction with production department
*   Ensure compliance on all raw materials, work-in-progress items and finished oatbase. Verify completion of analytical tests on oatbase
*   Verify in-process quality control lab testing, such as Total solids, pH, viscosity, particle size and organoleptic parameters, are recorded correctly and at required frequency
*   Validate Certificate of Analysis for product release
*   Maintain QC logs and other records
*   Crosstrain with QC Technicians to provide back up support during absences or high demand periods
*   Assist Quality Manager with training quality and operation personnel on laboratory tests, LIMS, SOPs, monitoring programs, and change control processes
*   Review, validate, and maintain compliance with all quality and manufacturing documents, electronic database ensuring timely approvals and updates
*   Maintain the document database(s) for creation, revision, and archiving of SOPs, work instructions, and other quality documents

**Other Duties**:

*   Perform other responsibilities as assigned to meet evolving business needs

**Here are the things we think you need:**

*   Bachelor’s degree in chemistry, biology or related discipline
*   2+ years of experience in a quality documentation or auditing role, preferably in food or beverage manufacturing
*   5-10 years of experience in food, chemistry and / or science
*   Lean/OPEX/Six sigma preferred
*   Experience conducting internal audits and co-manufacturer audits preferred
*   Experience from Quality Control and/or Quality assurance and Quality manage System
*   HACCP and PCQI certifications are a plus
*   Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite; experience with document management systems is a plus
*   Familiarity with regulatory compliance (FDA, FSMA, HACCP, BRC)
*   Strong attention to detail, organizational, and analytical skills
*   Effective communication and collaboration abilities
*   A minimum of 3 years experience of independently leading quality work in a formal or informal leader role
*   Self-starter with minimal supervision required and a commitment to individual accountability

**And here’s another list of qualities we think make a good Oatly team member**:

*   You feel connected to our mission of encouraging health, sustainability, and transparency
*   You are a self-starter who doesn’t need direct supervision to motivate you for success – we believe strongly in building a culture of individual accountability and ownership and need partners that can embrace that mentality
*   You are ready to make your mark in a smaller, growing brand leveraging your experience to deliver amazing results and build an outstanding company
*   You have an entrepreneurial spirit in that you’re comfortable with ambiguity and are energized by the process of building something lasting from the ground up
*   You enjoy sharing your quirkiness and talents with your coworkers

Another bulleted list felt redundant, so we wrote this long sentence with all the ways we sweeten the deal to work with us, like providing paid vacation, really great benefits, genuinely great coworkers who want to see the company and each other succeed, and a start-up vibe with an established company history.

The salary for this role will be based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to geographic location, internal equity, experience, education, specialty, and training. Actual compensation is influenced by a wide array of factors including but not limited to skill set, level of experience, and specific location. Compensation may also include bonus, commission, or equity as applicable. Our good faith estimate for base salary is $70,000.

Our team is available to support you through the hiring process with reasonable accommodations to enable a barrier-free interview experience. We will maintain candidate privacy and confidentiality to enable an unbiased and equitable experience.

Any action taken with personal data is called processing, regardless of whether it is carried out in an automated manner or not. Examples of common processing procedures are collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, transfer or erasure.

The legal basis for processing personal data which we receive through an unsolicited application where we currently do not have any open positions to offer, or which we store after a completed recruitment process (regarding a position which has been assigned to another applicant) is the consent given by you to such processing.

When your personal data is shared with a data processor, it is only for purposes that are compatible with the purposes for which we have collected the data. We have written agreements with all our data processors through which they guarantee the security of the personal data processed and undertake to comply with our security requirements as well as restrictions and requirements regarding the international transfer of personal data.

Personal data may also be disclosed by us if it is necessary to comply with applicable legal or governmental requirements, to safeguard our legal interests or to detect, prevent or be attentive to fraud and other security or technical issues.

**Where do we process your personal data?**

We always strive for the processing of your personal data to take place within the EU/EEA. However, we may be required to transfer the data to a non-EU/EEA country, for example if we share your personal data with a data processor who, either themselves or through a sub-supplier, is established or stores data in a non-EU country. In this case, the data processor shall only be granted access to data relevant to the purpose. Regardless of the country in which your personal data is processed, we take all the necessary legal, technical and organizational measures to ensure that the level of protection is the same as within the EU/EEA.

In cases where personal data is processed outside the EU/EEA, the level of protection is guaranteed either by a decision of the EU Commission that the country concerned ensures an adequate level of protection or through the use of so-called appropriate safeguards. Examples of appropriate safeguards are: approved code of conduct in the destination country, standard contract clauses, or Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs).

**What are your rights as data subject?**

Right of access (Subject Access Request). We are always open and transparent about how we process your personal data and, if you require further information regarding which personal data we process about you in particular, you can request access to a copy of such data. Please note that if we receive a subject access request, we may ask for additional data to ensure the effective handling of your request and that the information is given to the correct person.

Right to rectification. If your personal data is incorrect, you may request its correction. Within the stated purpose, you also have the right to supplement any incomplete personal data.

Oatly may also, on its own initiative, correct, disassociate, delete or supplement data that is found to be incorrect, incomplete or misleading.

Right to erasure. You may request the deletion of the personal data we process about you if: - The data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it has been collected or processed. - The personal data is processed in an unlawful way. - The personal data must be deleted to comply with a legal obligation we are subject to.

\- Withdraw your consent (see below).

Please note that we may have the right to deny your request if the processing is necessary for us to determine, enforce or defend legal claims. Should we be prevented from meeting a request for deletion, we will instead block personal data from being used for purposes other than the purpose that prevents the requested deletion.

Right to withdraw consent. If Oatly processes personal data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw the consent at any time through a written notice sent to the Oatly company that is responsible for the processing of your personal data.

Right to restriction. You may, in some cases, have the right to demand that the processing of your personal data is limited. By limitation, it means that the data is marked so that in future it will only be processed for certain limited purposes.

The right to restriction applies, inter alia, to the fact that the data is incorrect and relates to a request for it to be corrected. In such cases, you may also request that the data processing is restricted during the time that the data is being corrected.

If processing is restricted, we may, in addition to storage, only process the data in order to apply or defend legal claims to protect someone else's rights or if you have given your consent.

Right to data portability. If our right to process your personal data is based on your consent or performance of an agreement with you, you have the right to request for the data that relates to you and which you have provided to us to be transferred to another data controller (so-called data portability). A prerequisite for data portability is that the transfer is technically feasible and can be automated.

**How is your personal data protected?**

We have taken appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data against unlawful and unauthorized processing, e.g. we use IT-systems to protect the privacy, integrity and availability of personal data for which we are data controller.

**What can you do if you are dissatisfied with our processing of your personal data?**

Should you be dissatisfied with our processing of your personal data, please let us know, and we will do our best to meet your complaints. Your integrity is very important to us, and we always strive to protect and secure your personal data in the best possible way.  Should we nevertheless, in your opinion, fail in this ambition, please note that you are also entitled to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority, which may be found below.
