**ABOUT KHAN ACADEMY**

Khan Academy is a nonprofit with the mission to deliver a free, world-class education to anyone anywhere. Our proven learning platform offers free, high-quality supplemental learning resources that cover Pre-K-12th grade and early college core academic subjects, with a focus on math and science. We have over 155 million registered learners globally and are committed to improving learning outcomes for students around the world, with a focus on learners in historically under-resourced communities.

**OUR COMMUNITY**

Our students, teachers, and parents come from all walks of life, and so do we. Our team includes people from academia, traditional/non-traditional education, big tech companies, and tiny startups. We hire great people from diverse backgrounds and experiences because it makes our company stronger. We value diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging as necessary to achieve our mission and impact the communities we serve. We know that transforming education starts in-house with learning about ourselves and our colleagues. We strive to be world-class in investing in our people and commit to developing you as a professional.

**THE ROLE**

As the temporary Technical Program Manager for Khanmigo Core Platform (5-month contract), you will be responsible for coordinating and balancing the priorities of internal "customer stakeholder" teams who are building Khanmigo experiences, partnering with Engineering and Product Management on aligning the roadmap. Your efforts will streamline our processes and ensure our teams are aligned and productive, which will enable us to build the best products to serve our mission.

You will:

*   Coordinate with internal “customer stakeholder” teams, such as Tutor Platform, Literacy, Teacher Experience, to understand their needs and balance their priorities.
*   Manage platform capabilities, including text to speech and vision.
*   Oversee developer frameworks, such as our Evaluations Component library being built.
*   Provide necessary tools for prompt engineers' workflows.
*   Coordinate internal upgrades, aligning different teams onto the latest models.
*   Ensure that evaluation test cases for every activity across teams are met.
*   Collaborate with internal dependency teams like Data Infra to ensure our Evaluations Component data fits the shape expected by the Data Infra team for tools like Langfuse.
*   Manage coordination for Khanmigo-as-a-Service partners for 3rd party customers leveraging the Khanmigo Platform.

**WHAT YOU BRING**

*   5+ years of Program Engineering or Product Management experience where you have successfully managed big data-focused programs (or multiple projects)  from inception to execution
*   Several years of hands-on experience in software development, with daily coding tasks (experience as a TPM building software platforms is an acceptable substitute). While this role does not involve daily coding, a technical background is essential for building a cutting-edge AI platform. Experience in AI/ML is preferred but not required.
*   Proficient in program/project management tools (e.g. Gantt charts, spreadsheets, JIRA, Confluence, presentations, etc.); comfortable collaborating in an online/cloud-based environment (e.g. Google Apps, Slack, etc.)
*   The ability to think creatively and use data to solve ambiguous and complex problems
*   Excellent interpersonal and communication skills to build relationships and influence across multiple levels of the organization comprised of technical and non-technical individuals 
*   Excellent organization skills, acute attention to detail, ability to balance multiple tasks in an ever-changing environment.

**Live & breathe learners**

We deeply understand and empathize with our users. We leverage user insights, research, and experience to build content, products, services, and experiences that our users trust and love. Our success is defined by the success of our learners and educators.

**Take a stand**

As a company, we have conviction in our aspirational point of view of how education will evolve. The work we do is in service to moving towards that point of view. However, we also listen, learn and flex in the face of new data, and commit to evolving this point of view as the industry and our users evolve.

**Embrace diverse perspectives**

We are a diverse community. We seek out and embrace a diversity of voices, perspectives and life experiences leading to stronger, more inclusive teams and better outcomes. As individuals, we are committed to bringing up tough topics and leaning into different points of view with curiosity. We actively listen, learn and collaborate to gain a shared understanding. When a decision is made, we commit to moving forward as a united team.

**Work responsibly and sustainably**

We understand that achieving our audacious mission is a marathon, so we set realistic timelines and we focus on delivery that also links to the bigger picture. As a non-profit, we are supported by the generosity of donors as well as strategic partners, and understand our responsibility to our finite resources. We spend every dollar as though it were our own. We are responsible for the impact we have on the world and to each other. We ensure our team and company stay healthy and financially sustainable.

**Bring out the joy**

We are committed to making learning a joyful process. This informs what we build for our users and the culture we co-create with our teammates, partners and donors.

**Cultivate learning mindset**

We believe in the power of growth for learners and for ourselves. We constantly learn and teach to improve our offerings, ourselves, and our organization. We learn from our mistakes and aren’t afraid to fail. We don't let past failures or successes stop us from taking future bold action and achieving our goals.

**Deliver wow**

We insist on high standards and deliver delightful, effective end-to-end experiences that our users can rely on. We choose to focus on fewer things — each of which aligns to our ambitious vision — so we can deliver high-quality experiences that accelerate positive measurable learning with our strategic partners.

_We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, or Veteran status. We value diversity, equity, and inclusion, and we encourage candidates from historically underrepresented groups to apply._

**Why are you being asked to complete this form?**

We are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.

Completing this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way.
