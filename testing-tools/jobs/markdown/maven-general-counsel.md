The Deputy General Counsel role will be critical to our ability to scale Maven's unique virtual care model while adhering to applicable regulations. We need a forward-thinking, collaborative and optimistic leader who can help us solve the many complex issues that surface working across different healthcare populations while managing hyper-growth.

**As Deputy General Counsel, you will:**

*   Help build a playbook for Maven Clinic’s expansion globally - including new market launch best practices, entity structuring and critical regulatory and employment matters
*   Develop influential relationships, mutual trust, and collaborative partnerships within the legal team, as well as with senior leaders, engineers, product designers, and business partners throughout the company
*   Serve as a collaborative partner and advisor to the General Counsel on all strategic matters related to legal, compliance, data, and regulatory matters
*   Provide thoughtful counsel on risk mitigation, compliance requirements, create processes and workflows

**We're looking for you to bring:**

*   12+ years of legal experience, with at least 5+ years in-house in healthcare or digital-health
*   Direct experience in, or working with, with health plans: you’ve negotiated contracts with payers and have a point of view on data sharing best-practices and commercial terms
*   Demonstrated success as a people leader and as a strategic partner to business units and the executive team
*   The ability to build and scale a legal "machine", utilizing technology/tools and replicable processes
*   Comfort speaking and writing about complex matters with sufficient simplicity and pragmatism to communicate clearly with both legal and non-legal partners across all levels of the organization.
*   Excellent negotiating skills, keen analytical abilities, ability to advise on risk mitigation solutions, as well as a track record of success in handling complex business and legal issues in a fast-paced, agile and evolving technology-driven business environment
*   Sound and practical business judgment, intellectual creativity, and problem-solving skills
*   Experience with payments, international growth, or late state/IPOs stage growth is highly desired
