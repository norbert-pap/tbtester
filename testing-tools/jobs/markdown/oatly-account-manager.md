--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apply for this job

Hello potential future Oatly employee. It’s us, the original oatmilk company that started in Sweden back 25 or so years ago and has since expanded to the U.S. where we’ve continued growing at a rate such that we need more brilliant minds to come work with us to keep the momentum going and the oatmilk flowing.

**WHY OATLY?**
--------------

Sustainability, health, and transparency are the core values that guide everything we do. Basically, we exist to make it easy for people to eat better and live healthier lives without recklessly taxing the planet’s resources in the process. If any of this resonates with you, then maybe you’d like work for Oatly, too. Now onto the formal stuff.

We are looking for a Key Account Manager to co-lead our OOH and Foodservice channel in Mexico . This role will be responsible for driving distribution and sales with enthusiasm and passion for Oatly’s purpose, mission, and values. Reporting to the Commercial Director, the position exists to create the Oatly experience, drive sales, build market share, and increase brand awareness while establishing long-term relationships with key customers within the foodservice and OOH channel.

#### **WHAT WE NEED YOU TO DO**

For this role, you will partner with the Country manager and coordinate with the honoymous for Mexico. Your commitment is to expand and execute our foodservice strategy across Mexico to drive our mission, drive conversion and grow sales and awareness.

More things you will do:

*   Expand and execute our foodservice strategy across Mexico to drive our mission, drive conversion and grow sales and awareness.
*   Build strong and valuable relationships with major wholesalers, distributors and customers across all segments within the OOH and food service channel.
*   Direct the annual planning in the geography for all business related to general broad-line foodservice distribution.
*   Take the lead in negotiations with key regional customers.
*   Set and evaluate both short- and long-term goals to ensure our sales resources are aligned with company strategy.
*   Own budgeting and forecasting of sales for the geography and participate in the development of strategic direction and goals.
*   Own delivery of monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales and business targets.

But, you know. These are just the things we can think of right now! This might be the job today, but tomorrow brings more change, so being light on your feet and willing to embrace the unknown is a verrrrrry big help.

#### WHAT WE NEED YOU TO BRING TO THE TABLE

*   Minimum of 7 years in foodservice or related roles in the consumer-packaged **goods** industry.
*   Strong knowledge of the foodservice landscape in Mexico.
*   Extensive network of distributors, organized chains, and key foodservice accounts.
*   Bonus points for expertise in the coffee industry and foodservice-oriented products.
*   Be curious to find opportunities in the huge OOH Mexican Market
*   Based in Mexico City.
*   Proven track record of driving growth within Foodservice.

#### **WHO WE NEED YOU TO BE**

###### **We think your oatsomeness is built upon the following qualities:**

*   Experienced leader with strong influencing and communication skills.
*   Excellent organisational skills and a sharp eye for detail.
*   Motivated, positive, values-driven and a passion for relationship building across teams as well as external partners and customers.
*   Target-oriented and results-driven with a passion for high performance.
*   Ability to prioritise and manage time effectively, while thriving in a hybrid environment.
*   Problem-solving skills and a desire to bring creative solutions to business opportunities.
*   Advanced negotiation skills and business acumen.
*   Open to travel across the region.

#### And here’s another list of qualities we think make a good Oatly team member:

*   You feel connected to our mission of encouraging health, sustainability, and transparency
*   You are a self-starter who doesn’t need direct supervision to motivate you for success – we believe strongly in building a culture of individual accountability and ownership, and need partners who can embrace that mentality.
*   You are ready to make your mark in a smaller, growing brand, leveraging your experience to deliver amazing results and build an outstanding company.
*   You have an entrepreneurial spirit in that you’re comfortable with ambiguity and are energised by the process of building something lasting from the ground up.
*   You enjoy sharing your quirkiness and talents with your coworkers.

Another bulleted list felt redundant, so we wrote this long sentence with all the ways we sweeten the deal to work with us, like providing 20 days paid vacation for starters, really great benefits with 100% medical coverage, genuinely great coworkers who want to see the company and each other succeed, a start-up vibe with an established company history, and a fridge full of the best non-dairy alternative in the world for your enjoyment.

#### **YOUR APPLICATION**

**Phew! Well done if you’ve got this far. We’re glad we’ve still got your attention because we’ve got one last super important point to make.  
**

As you can probably tell, we’re a norm-breaking company. For us, diversity and differences are obvious assets. We know that amazing candidates can sometimes be put off applying for a job unless they can tick every box, and that makes us really sad. So please trust your gut and pop in your application if it’s feeling right. If you have the curiosity, passion, and collaborative spirit, let’s do this together! It will be fun!

Last day of application: 15th of May.

_We treat all candidates equally: If you are interested, please apply through our application system - any correspondence should come from there. This will ensure that the candidate experience is smooth and fair to everyone!_

#### THE OATLY WAY

Oatly is a company built on the idea of change. Our mission is to make it easy for people to eat better and live healthier lives without recklessly taxing the planet’s resources. It's why we come to work every day. With head office in Malmö and production in Sweden, Netherlands, China, Singapore, and the US, our products are available in almost 30 countries across Europe, North America, and Asia.

_Love Oatly xxx_

The legal basis for processing personal data which we receive through an unsolicited application where we currently do not have any open positions to offer, or which we store after a completed recruitment process (regarding a position which has been assigned to another applicant) is the consent given by you to such processing.

Data processors are companies that process data on our behalf and according to our instructions. For the handling of job applications and processing of personal data in relation to recruitment processes, Oatly has engaged Teamtailor AB, a provider of an IT-system for e.g. collection of job applications and communication with applicants, as data processor.

When your personal data is shared with a data processor, it is only for purposes that are compatible with the purposes for which we have collected the data. We have written agreements with all our data processors through which they guarantee the security of the personal data processed and undertake to comply with our security requirements as well as restrictions and requirements regarding the international transfer of personal data.

Personal data may also be disclosed by us if it is necessary to comply with applicable legal or governmental requirements, to safeguard our legal interests or to detect, prevent or be attentive to fraud and other security or technical issues.

**Where do we process your personal data?**

We always strive for the processing of your personal data to take place within the EU/EEA. However, we may be required to transfer the data to a non-EU/EEA country, for example if we share your personal data with a data processor who, either themselves or through a sub-supplier, is established or stores data in a non-EU country. In this case, the data processor shall only be granted access to data relevant to the purpose. Regardless of the country in which your personal data is processed, we take all the necessary legal, technical and organizational measures to ensure that the level of protection is the same as within the EU/EEA.

In cases where personal data is processed outside the EU/EEA, the level of protection is guaranteed either by a decision of the EU Commission that the country concerned ensures an adequate level of protection or through the use of so-called appropriate safeguards. Examples of appropriate safeguards are: approved code of conduct in the destination country, standard contract clauses, or Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs).

**What are your rights as data subject?**

Right of access (Subject Access Request). We are always open and transparent about how we process your personal data and, if you require further information regarding which personal data we process about you in particular, you can request access to a copy of such data. Please note that if we receive a subject access request, we may ask for additional data to ensure the effective handling of your request and that the information is given to the correct person.

Right to rectification. If your personal data is incorrect, you may request its correction. Within the stated purpose, you also have the right to supplement any incomplete personal data.

Oatly may also, on its own initiative, correct, disassociate, delete or supplement data that is found to be incorrect, incomplete or misleading.

Right to erasure. You may request the deletion of the personal data we process about you if: - The data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it has been collected or processed. - The personal data is processed in an unlawful way. - The personal data must be deleted to comply with a legal obligation we are subject to.

\- Withdraw your consent (see below).

Please note that we may have the right to deny your request if the processing is necessary for us to determine, enforce or defend legal claims. Should we be prevented from meeting a request for deletion, we will instead block personal data from being used for purposes other than the purpose that prevents the requested deletion.

Right to withdraw consent. If Oatly processes personal data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw the consent at any time through a written notice sent to the Oatly company that is responsible for the processing of your personal data.

Right to restriction. You may, in some cases, have the right to demand that the processing of your personal data is limited. By limitation, it means that the data is marked so that in future it will only be processed for certain limited purposes.

The right to restriction applies, inter alia, to the fact that the data is incorrect and relates to a request for it to be corrected. In such cases, you may also request that the data processing is restricted during the time that the data is being corrected.

If processing is restricted, we may, in addition to storage, only process the data in order to apply or defend legal claims to protect someone else's rights or if you have given your consent.

Right to data portability. If our right to process your personal data is based on your consent or performance of an agreement with you, you have the right to request for the data that relates to you and which you have provided to us to be transferred to another data controller (so-called data portability). A prerequisite for data portability is that the transfer is technically feasible and can be automated.

**How is your personal data protected?**

We have taken appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data against unlawful and unauthorized processing, e.g. we use IT-systems to protect the privacy, integrity and availability of personal data for which we are data controller.

**What can you do if you are dissatisfied with our processing of your personal data?**

Should you be dissatisfied with our processing of your personal data, please let us know, and we will do our best to meet your complaints. Your integrity is very important to us, and we always strive to protect and secure your personal data in the best possible way.  Should we nevertheless, in your opinion, fail in this ambition, please note that you are also entitled to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority, which may be found below.
