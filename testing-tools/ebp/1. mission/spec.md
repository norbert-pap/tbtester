# Mission & purpose

Why Your Mission Matters in Hiring

A strong mission or purpose statement isn’t just a box to check-it’s your company’s “why,” and it’s a huge part of what attracts great people. The best candidates want to work somewhere that stands for something, and your mission is often the first thing they see-on your career page, in job ads, on social, and even in interviews.

A good mission statement is clear, authentic, and inspiring. It tells people what you’re about, why you exist, and what makes you different.
Quick Checklist

    Is it clear and easy to understand?
